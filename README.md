# Mobile Demo (Expo - React Native)

## Setup
1. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. `cd mobile`
3. `npm install`
4. Start the app: `npm start` then run on emulator or Expo Go.

## Notes
- The API URL in App.js is set to `http://10.0.2.2:8000/chat` which maps Android emulator to host machine.
- Replace with your deployed backend URL when you deploy the server.# recommend-product
